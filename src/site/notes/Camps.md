There was concern among Soviet leaders that citizens that had been outside the supervision of the government and security services may need screening to ensure their political loyalty.By the end of World War II they handled screening of all people from the Soviet territories occupied by Nazi Germany. The NKVD special-purpose camps were established by NKVD Order No. 001735 of December 28, 1941, titled "–û —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏–∏ —Å–ø–µ—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö –ª–∞–≥–µ—Ä–µ–π –¥–ª—è –±—ã–≤—à–∏—Ö –≤–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å–ª—É–∂–∞—â–∏—Ö –ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–π –ê—Ä–º–∏–∏, –Ω–∞—Ö–æ–¥–∏–≤—à–∏—Ö—Å—è –≤ –ø–ª–µ–Ω—É –∏ –≤ –æ–∫—Ä—É–∂–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–∏–∫–∞" ("On the establishment of special camps for former soldiers of the Red Army who were in captivity, or were surrounded by the enemy"). By NKVD Order No. 00100 of February 20, 1945, they were renamed to "–ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ—Ä–æ—á–Ω–æ-—Ñ–∏–ª—å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –ª–∞–≥–µ—Ä—è" ("verification and filtration camps"). Surviving POWs (about 1.5 million), repatriated Ostarbeiter, and other displaced persons totaling more than 4,000,000 people were sent to special NKVD filtration camps (distinct from the Gulags).

Russia‚Äôs filtration operations in Ukraine are devastating the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians. A new Conflict Observatory report shines a light on these and other atrocities. We will continue to work to hold Russian officials accountable.

Russia has set up a brutal internment (concentration) camp for Ukraine civilians in Kharkiv Oblast in the town of Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast.

Camps

  

They stretch across the vast Russian Steppes and across 11 time zones over the Ural Mountains from Belgorod in the west to the remote Kamchatka Peninsula on the edge of the Pacific Ocean and Vladivostok at the end of the Trans-Siberian railroad.

  

With names that belie the misery being suffered by their occupants after surviving two months of war, they include the Little Prince in Perm, the Santa in Tatarstan, the Friendly Guys in Omsk, the Forest Fairy Tale in Chuvashia, the Blue Lakes in Pskov and the Pine Forest in Ulyanovsk.

  

With an average of 162 people in each, our analysis suggests Russia could need about 6,000 camps to house the total number of people it claims have crossed the border.

On the wild Kamchatka peninsula at the edge of the Pacific Ocean, 10 people including children from Kherson were placed in a dormitory of the Kamchatka Industrial College in Yelizovo on 26 April following an eight-hour flight. About 200 people are expected in the region.

  

In Russia‚Äôs far eastern Maritime Territory, which is closer to Tokyo than it is to Moscow, a local newspaper reported in late April how 300 people, including 86 children, pregnant women and pensioners, arrived in Vladivostok after an exhausting seven-day journey on the Trans-Siberian Express from Taganrog.

  

The new arrivals, including survivors of the Mariupol siege, were taken to the Vostok hotel complex on the coast near Nakhodka. It was the third train to arrive

At a go-kart track in Belgorod, where people are staying in tents, a journalist reported having to go through two check points with armed men whose faces were covered with balaclavas.

  

In Ufa, the location of the TAPs was described by officials as ‚Äúclassified information‚Äù, but one report of a site in a university hostel said it was fenced and access was only allowed with security passes ‚Äúso people will be safe‚Äù.

Ukraine‚Äôs human rights ombudsman said the Russian military was holding more than 3,000 civilians from Mariupol at another former penal colony near Olenivka in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine.

Seven buses carrying an unknown number of Ukrainian soldiers evacuated from the Mariupol steel plant were seen arriving Tuesday at former penal colony No 120 near Olenivka.

Ombudsman Lyudmyla Denisova said on Telegram earlier on Tuesday that the civilians were being held at former penal colony No 52, also near Olenivka. She said most civilians are held for a month, but those considered ‚Äúparticularly unreliable,‚Äù including former soldiers and police, are held for two months.

Denisova said those held include about 30 volunteers who delivered humanitarian supplies to Mariupol while it was under Russian siege.

More than 3,000 civilians from Mariupol, a southern city taken by the Russian military, are reportedly being held in a "filtration prison," a former correctional colony, in the village of Olevivka, Lyudmyla Denisova, Ukraine's ombudsman for human rights, wrote. That is part of the Donbas region, which Russia has claimed their goal was to "liberate" during the invasion.

Recently the Russians¬†deported 108 Ukrainian children https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2022/07/19/7358914/ who had been deprived of parental care from Donetsk Oblast to the territory of Russia and placed them with foster families.

As of today, 5,100 cases of child deportation have been officially confirmed, and the number is increasing every day.

  

"In open sources, the Russian authorities give a figure of 350,000 children who have allegedly been ‚Äòevacuated‚Äô to Russia. During the evacuation these children should have been immediately brought back to the territory of Ukraine, but this didn‚Äôt happen.
