## Ukraine OSINT Project

This project works with Obsidian and Digital Obsidian Garden. It is currently in progress. 

Hello. Glad you could make it.

On February 24, 2022, Russia invaded the sovereign nation of Ukraine giving any number of crazy excuses for their invasion, brutality, rape, looting, cultural genocide and indiscriminate slaughter of civilians and children.

Due to this unjust and brutal invasion, the OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) Community has come together, combining specialties and tools in support of Ukraine. Sometimes, it takes a village.

This site will take you on the journey of building and integrating tools that can be applied to assorted projects, with the current use case being the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 

What you won't find here - military losses, troop movements or military commentary. This project began as a use case pushing Obsidian as far as it could go in order to understand the acts of partisan and civilian sabotage, protest and direct action within Russia and Belarus. This has expanded to other use cases, some of which include Ukraine.

For Russian losses, check out Ragnar's awesome dashboard where you can visualize multiple views for the same data in useful and insightful ways.

A few points about this data.

This began as a compilation of events that indicate citizens within Russia and Belarus may be taking action as anti-war direct action and sabotage. The data of those kinds of events currently spans February 2022 to July 2022, but will be expanded with time. It is often impossible to verify whether or not an event is an act of sabotage or the result of shoddy Russian building standards and materials. Best-guess efforts are made, based on timing, location and targets (whether they might be strategic or political or protest related), claims of individuals or groups as to their direct action activities and legal case filings against people in Russia for "terrorism" or "hooliganism". As such, all reports are included if there is the potential of sabotage to leave room for more information to become available. It is up to you to include or exclude the events of your choice, based on your own criteria
In all cases, we have taken steps to protect the identities of vulnerable individuals or groups. In cases where names and details linked to them have been made officially public in Russia or Belarus, we have retained that information (such as arrest or court records). In cases of self-attribution, we have included this at our discretion as well.

The project scope has since grown and eventually hopes to identify the remaining camps and areas within Russia that Ukrainians were forcibly removed to. It's estimated, based on the amount of reported forcibly removed Ukrainians, that a minimum of 6,000 locations exist. Only a small fraction have been identified. When this war ends, Ukraine, family and friends, will need to know where to find their people.

This data was compiled from reporting in global media, local and regional reporting, white papers, reports, curated Telegram channels, [[activism|activist]] websites, alert and monitoring programs and apps, and from curated accounts on Twitter such as @AmplifyUkraine, @VelvetBlade, @DemeryUK, @TWMCLtd, @StillDelvingH, @HarladF, @Russiasonfire, @Bellingcat

The data was augmented by several sources, including lists of military contracting companies and factories within Russia, Wikipedia, WikiVoyage, WordNik, WordNet, CartoDB and other curated lists.

This vault will be updated as more data becomes available and more "care and feeding" goes into drawing out meaning and connections

## How to Use this Vault
This vault was created with Obsidian, a free and expandable open source markdown project. Since this is a cobbler project, expect things to improve over time. Current work is focused on expanding connections, uncovering hidden relationships and somehow making this available in its entirety to anyone who is interested in exploring this data.

Obsidian is a rich community of enthusiasts and this project has been enhanced on the shoulders of several plug-ins created by talented and creative members of the community.


## Roadmap

Obsidian is an excellent markdown tool and can do many things. This use is not really how it was intended to be used, but we wanted to stretch and create a use case for the OSINT potential within Obsidian. Getting some of these roadmap items to work with Obsidian might be a bit of a dance, but we are of the mind that one should always look at a problem and find potential solutions. This sparks the creativity of puzzle solvers.

Currently most of this work is done by hand and so is in a constant state of "in progress". Automating some of this once there is a baseline is a goal.

- Add curated and translated Telegram posts from https://osintukraine.com (If you want to support an excellent OSINT project that helps Ukraine in many ways, please support this one by Ben Borges)
- Add Bellingcat Events data with losses removed
- Add Human Rights database for filtration, detention and forced deportations
- Fix issue with maps where icons are all the same (I have no clue why changes made have not been reflected)
- Expand export capabilities
- Analysis of direct action and potential sabotage within Russia and Belarus from partisans
- Analysis of known camp locations and forced deportation end stations within Russia to create a model for finding the missing thousands of camps
- Add secret magic sauce



== NOTE FROM TEMPLATE ==

This is the template to be used together with the [Digital Garden Obsidian Plugin](https://github.com/oleeskild/Obsidian-Digital-Garden). 
See the README in the plugin repo for information on how to set it up.

## Custom Styling
I encourage you to change the default styling to make the site your own. Please modify the custom-style.scss when doing so to avoid future conflict when updating the template.
